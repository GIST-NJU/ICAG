Incremental Covering Array Generation
==============================================================================

Generator
----
Please refer to the directory `generator`, which provides the generator used to produce icremental covering arrays and its instruction.

Test Models
----
Please refer to the directory `model`, which contains the input models of the seven subject programs.

Covering Arrays
----
Please refer to the directory `covering_arrays`, which lists various strength sub-covering arrays in the incremental covering arrays generated by the Bottom-up and Top-down strategies for the seven subject programs.

Interaction Coverage
----
Please refer to the directory `interaction_coverage`, which provides the results of the higher-strength interactions of the lower-strength sub-covering arrays in the incremental covering arrays generated by the two strategies.

Test Suites
----
Please refer to the directory `test_suites`, which contains the test cases corresponding to the incremental covering arrays and used to test the subject programs.

Fault Detection
----
Please refer to the directory `fault_detection`, which provides the number of the faults detected by the test suites.

Code Coverage
----
Please refer to the directory `code_coverage`, which provides the number of the code lines covered by the test suites.
