# Interaction Coverage of 2-wise sub-covering Arrays  for largest strength 5
Please refer to Table 1 in the file `interactiom_coverage.pdf`, which lists the coverage of `3, 4, 5 and 6`-strength interactions of `2-wise` sub-covering arrays in the incremental covering arrays with strengths of 2 to 5 generated by Bottom-up and Top-down strategies.

# Interaction Coverage of 3-wise sub-covering Arrays for largest strength 6
Please refer to Table 2 in the file `interactiom_coverage.pdf`, which lists the coverage of `3, 4, 5 and 6`-strength interactions of `2-wise` sub-covering arrays in the incremental covering arrays with strengths of 2 to 6 generated by Bottom-up and Top-down strategies.

# Interaction Coverage of 4-wise sub-covering Arrays for largest strength 7
Please refer to Table 3 in the file `interactiom_coverage.pdf`, which lists the coverage of `3, 4, 5 and 6`-strength interactions of `2-wise` sub-covering arrays in the incremental covering arrays with strengths of 2 to 7 generated by Bottom-up and Top-down strategies.
