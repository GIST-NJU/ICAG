# Test cases<br>
## Findutils
The test cases  are used to test subject Findutils.  
## Flex 
The test cases  are used to test subject Flex.  
## Grep(CoRE)
The test cases  are used to test subject Grep(CoRE).  
## Grep(SIR)
The test cases  are used to test subject Grep(SIR).  
## Gzip
The test cases  are used to test subject Gzip.  
## Make
The test cases  are used to test subject Make.  
## Sed
The test cases  are used to test subject Sed.  
These test cases correspond to the incremental covering array with largest strength six and are sorted in ascending order of test strength. 

# Subject Programs<br>
The five subject programs including Flex, Grep(SIR), Gzip, Make and Sed  and their mutants can be downloaded from here:<br>

# Workflow<br>
We follow the workflow of [SIR](https://sir.csc.ncsu.edu/portal/index.php) to run the subject programs and collect the code coverage and fault-revealing information of the test casees.
