## Grep(CoRE)
The directory contains the test cases used to test subject `Grep(CoRE)`.  
## Grep(SIR)
The directory contains the test cases used to test subject `Grep(SIR)`.  
## Gzip
The directory contains the test cases used to test subject `Gzip`.

Notes:<br>
* These test cases correspond to the incremental covering arrays with largest strength six and are sorted in ascending order of test strength. 
* The test cases with `Bottom-up` in  the file name indicate that the corresponding covering arrays are generated by `Bottom-up` strategy.
* The test cases with `Top-down` in the file name indicate that the corresponding covering arrays are generated by `Top-down` strategy.

# Subject Programs<br>
The five subject programs including Flex, Grep(SIR), Gzip, Make and Sed  and their mutants can be downloaded from here:<br>

# Workflow<br>
We follow the workflow of [SIR](https://sir.csc.ncsu.edu/portal/index.php) to run the subject programs and collect the code coverage and fault-revealing information of the test casees.
