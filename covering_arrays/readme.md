highest_strength_5
-------------------
The incremental covering arrays were generated with the highest strength set to 5.

highest_strength_6
-------------------
The  incremental  covering arrays were generated with the highest strength set to 6.

highest_strength_7
-------------------
The incremental covering arrays were generated with the highest strength set to 7.

generation_time_5
-------------------
The generation time  of incremental covering arrays consumed by Bottom-up and Top-down strategies  when the largest strength is 5. 

generation_time_6
-------------------
The generation time  of incremental covering arrays consumed by Bottom-up and Top-down strategies  when the largest strength is 6. 

generation_time_7
-------------------
The generation time  of incremental covering arrays consumed by Bottom-up and Top-down strategies  when the largest strength is 7. 

The above time is in milliseconds.
