# Incremental Covering Arrays (ICAs)

## Generated by Bottom-up Strategy
Please refer to the directory `Bottom-up`.

## Generated by Top-down Strategy
Please refer to the directorys `Top-down`.

Note:<br>
In these two directories, each ICA file is named `subject_n-m-wise.ica`, where n and m are the smallest and largest strength of the ICA.
For example, the ICA file with strengths of 2 to 5 for subject `Flex` is named `Flex_2-5-wise.ica`.<br><br>

# Sizes of sub-covering arrays of ICAs

## ICA with Strengths of 2 to 5
Please refer to the file `size_2-5-wise.pdf`.

## ICA with Strengths of 2 to 6
Please refer to the file `size_2-6-wise.pdf`.

## ICA with Strengths of 2 to 7
Please refer to the file `size_2-7-wise.pdf`.

# Generation Time

## ICA with Strengths of 2 to 5
Please refer to the file `time_2-5-wise.pdf`.

## ICA with Strengths of 2 to 6
Please refer to the file `time_2-6-wise.pdf`.

## ICA with Strengths of 2 to 7
Please refer to the file `time_2-7-wise.pdf`.<br><br>

Note:<br>
Time is in milliseconds.
