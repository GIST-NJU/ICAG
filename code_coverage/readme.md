Sed
---------- 
The nubmbers of code lines of each version of subject `Sed` were covered by the incremental covering arrays generated by Bottom-up and Top-down strategies.

We note that
* The largest strengths of incremental covering arrays are set to six. 
* In the above diretories, the names of files  consist of  two parts. The first one is the subject name and the second one is the version number.
